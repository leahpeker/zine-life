- **Text Editing** - Button wrapper prevents text editing functionality

## Priority Suggestions (UPDATED)
High Priority (next to implement):
1. Fix stamp rendering pipeline
2. Complete Speech Bubbles implementation  
3. Complete Text Banners/Ribbons
4. Tape Strips - Essential zine element
5. Lightning Bolts - Classic punk symbol

Medium Priority:

## TECHNICAL NOTES:
